# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

QR Code Generator project, week 12.

This week our task was to build a custom hook that would make the operating of a custom QR code generator possible and the application easy to use. My styling adds a little flair of mystic to the generator...

### The Problem

I started by going through the code by myself. Some things in it seemed quite understandable and some not so much.

I think I still need quite a bit of practice with basic JavaScript logic and I don't think I would've made this project work without Diego's lecture. I understand the solutions when they are presented to me but I struggle to come up with complex logic myself.

Comments still need to be added throughout the code!

# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

In this assigment we created a custom hook to generate QR codes. This is also the first project in which i used tailwind for styling. 

### The Problem

One problem I had was making a component for the color selector. I decided to include it directly into the App instead of importing it there as a component. The problem was trying to use the custom hook in that component.

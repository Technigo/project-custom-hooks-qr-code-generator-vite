# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

The core purpose of this project is to enable users to seamlessly input a URL, convert it into a QR code with ease, and conveniently download it as an image.

### The Problem

The existing code was mostly set up, so the primary task was understanding the custom hook. This week, there were numerous hints, and I found them a bit overwhelming. I recognized that the confusion stemmed from the way the hints were presented. Being new to coding, I'm not yet comfortable with the terminology, but with the assistance of Google and AI, I managed to comprehend it and start working. Initially, using the custom hook was a bit perplexing, likely because I've become accustomed to thinking in terms of components :D.

My main challenge revolved around recalling how to create and manipulate elements in the DOM. Consequently, I had to refer to documentation from both W3Schools and MDN to refresh and enhance my understanding.

This marked my initial experience incorporating an animation from the Lottie library. It was an enjoyable endeavor! I'm eager to explore and experiment further with this library.

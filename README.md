# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

This project involved creating a custom-made hook and using it to build a QR code generator. This allows you to download the QR code as a PNG file.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

The custom made hook was a bit tricky to understand. ChatGPT and Stack Overflow gave a lot of relevant information that I could apply in my project. We got a lots of hints within the boilerplate that I used in order to make it work and I also tried out other ways around.

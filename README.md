# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

The aim of this project was to create a QR code generator with the possibility to download the QR code. It was to be easy to use and possible to start over.

### The Problem

It took a while to understand the starting code, however once I did it was not that hard. 

The hardest part was the download part, the code was unfimiliar to me. There were many new things this project, but they were mostly logical to implement with that I have worked with before.

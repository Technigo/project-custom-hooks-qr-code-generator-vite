# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

Week 12 of Technigo bootcamp. A QR Code Generator with a custom hook to generate QR codes. 


### The Problem

The hooks were a bit tricky to understand. ChatGPT was used a lot to understand and learn how to create it. We got a lot of hints in the assignment, I followed some of them but also decided to try another way as well.

Tried out styled components for this week as well. Course material and google was used to implement it.

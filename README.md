# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

This is a project designed to practice react and custom hooks.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I started by looking though the provided code, and learning what it does and how it works. After that I started to implement my own solutions, with help from a coding session provided by my teacher.
My plan was to style the generator during the weekend, but life came in between and I didn't have time to do that.
If I had more time, I'd find and use some cool animations to make the site more interesting and fun.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.

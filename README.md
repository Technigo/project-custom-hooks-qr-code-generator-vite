# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

The goal of this project was to create a QR-code generator by calling the QRCode-library. A custom hook has been created. In addition, I added animations and changed the theme to light or dark.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

The biggest problem was to manipulate elements in the DOM - I totally forgot , but I google what some video.

# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

The QR Code Generator project lets users type in a URL, turn it into a QR code, and download it as an image. 
This project is built with the qrcode libary with a custom hook. 


### The Problem

To this project I used this week's learning material, Google and chatGPT. Took it step by step in according to the instructions. 

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.

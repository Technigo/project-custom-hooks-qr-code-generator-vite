# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

In this project the task was to create a custom hook to create a website where you can generate a QR code.

### The Problem

Since I never have worked with a custom hook it was a bit of a challenge to get to know the code and understanding it fully. But after I had read the code carefully a couple of time and asked chatGPT to explain the parts I didn't really grasp it felt pretty natural.

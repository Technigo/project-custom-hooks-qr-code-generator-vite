# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

In this project we create a custom hook to generate QR codes. The essence of this project is to let users input a URL, converting it into a QR code, so it can be downloaded as an image.

### The Problem

Since it was provided a lot of comments this week I started following them and also watched a video to figure out the steps. I found the second half of the project to be the hardest, with the download and getting the filename. I enjoyed trying out Lottie animations for the first time, there were some challenges with it too. Like setting the speed and figuring out how you can style it. For the animations and the footer, I have used components since from my understanding it was ok for everything but the QR code generation. When I have encountered problems I have googled information and asked chatGPT.

Favicon: Qr code icons created by Nadiinko - Flaticon.

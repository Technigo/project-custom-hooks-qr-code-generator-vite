# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

The assignment was to build a site where the user can generate a QR code from an URL, and then download the QR as an image and then repeat the steps if wanted. 

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I started off with looking at the code in the example and the provided code in the repo, then I worked step by step with implementing the functions, the hooks and the variable statements that I needed. After each step I tested the code and worked with it until everything worked nice and smooth.

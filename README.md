# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

The goal of this project was to create a QR-code generator by calling the QRCode-library. To obtain this I created a custom hook called useQRCodeGenerator.

### The Problem

To solve the problem I sketched out the variables and methods on paper. A lot of hints were also given in the instructions.
My biggest problem was remembering hos to create and manipulate elements in the DOM. So I had to read some MDN and W3-school documentation to freshen up my knowledge.

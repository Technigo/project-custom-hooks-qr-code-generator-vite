# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

The assignment was to create a qr-generator using a comstom react hook.

### The Problem

This week was one of the easier one I didn't quite get any problems creating it. No sure how much more there is to do with the app. But if there was more time this would ge great to have as a component in a larger project with more funtions.

# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

Here you can generate a QRcode from the URL.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

In this project, I tried to tackle TypeScript and Tailwind as a practice. As I wanted to try new technologies, I also tried to work with Three.js. As I am an absolute beginner, I was not able to create auch a interesting objects with Three.js, but it was great fun to explore how all the numbers are connected to each other. The biggest issue was declaring types with ts. As I am also beginner with TS, I learned a lot how to declare types and how to work with it. I need of course more and more practice with both new technologies, TS and Three.js!!

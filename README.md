## QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

In this project we got to build a QR code generator by creating a custom hook.

### The Problem

By using a QR code library and implementing this into a custom hook it was relatively simple to build this QR code generator. By using an additional library, React Color, I could add a colour picker, which enables the user customise the colours of the QR code.

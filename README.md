# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

A project meant to teach how to use custom hooks by creating a qr-code generator.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I checked the material and provided videos and just dove right in. I also researched as I went and applied what I learned in lectures.

Tech and frameworks:
useRef, custom hooks, Lottie animations, qrcode package, react

# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

React & Vite Boiler Plate project for Technigo students: Generate QR codes from URLs, utilising custom hooks for efficient state management.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I spent a little bit of time to understand what the custom hook is for, what is the connection between the App component and the hook.
The project looks easy but there are still some new concepts which I took some time to digest such as the download URL.

### View it live

Here is the deploy version of the website:

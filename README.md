# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

Here you can generate a QRcode from the URL. 

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

In this project, I tried to tackle TypeScript and Tailwind as a practice. Also, I am adding some animations to make it fun!! 

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
